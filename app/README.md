## Getting Started

In this section, I will explain how to get **only** this part of the project running on Ubuntu.

### Prerequisites
* docker
  ```sh
    sudo apt install docker docker-compose 
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. make the starting script executable
   ```sh
   sudo chmod +x app.sh
   ```
3. run the starting script ( you might want to  add **sudo** if your docker runs with super user privileges)
   ```sh
   ./app.sh
   ```
